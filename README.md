# C++ Projects – Semester 2 Assignments

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects developed during the second semester of college. Each project focuses on fundamental data structures and algorithms, implemented using the Dev-C++ IDE.

## 📁 Project List

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.
- **Hospital Queue System**: Simulation of a patient queue management system using queue data structures.
- **Double Linked List**: Demonstration of operations on a doubly linked list.
- **Rayhan Laundry**: A laundry management system project, possibly involving customer orders and processing.
- **Single Linked List**: Implementation and manipulation of a singly linked list.
- **Tree**: Basic operations and traversal methods on tree data structures.
